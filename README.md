## 📑 Report Contents
The key topics to be covered are as follows:

**🚀 Basic Kotlin Concepts:**
  In this unit, we will delve into the fundamentals of Kotlin, exploring essential object-oriented programming and lambda concepts. These knowledge will provide the necessary foundation for interactive application development.

**⚙️ Add a Button to an App:**
  In this section, we will learn to incorporate interactivity into our Android applications. We will explore how to add a button and respond to click events in an app. This will allow for greater dynamics in user-app interaction.

**⚙️ Interact with User Interface and State:**
  We will continue building upon your previous Kotlin skills, taking you beyond the basics. We will dive into creating a tip calculator application, where you will learn to handle the user interface and manage the application state to enhance the user experience. Let's create together!

This learning path provides further mastery in developing interfaces in **Android** applications.

## 🎮 Running the App
Additionally, to build and run your Android application locally, follow these steps using Android Studio:

1. Open your project in Android Studio.

2. Ensure all dependencies are correctly configured.

3. Click the "Build" button to compile your application.

4. Once the build is complete, select an emulator or connect a physical device.

5. Click the "Run" button to execute the application on the emulator or device.

Please note that these steps assume you have already set up your development environment correctly and that your application is error-free. Enjoy building and running your application in Android Studio!


## 📄 Compiling the Report
If you want to compile the report on Overleaf instead of doing it on your local machine, you can follow these steps:

1. Open your project in Overleaf (make sure you have created an account on Overleaf and imported your project there).

2. Locate the "codelab.tex" file in the project in Overleaf.

3. Click on the "codelab.tex" file to open it in the Overleaf editor.

4. At the top of the editor, you will see a button called "Recompile" or "Compile" (it may vary depending on the version of Overleaf). Click on this button.

5. Overleaf will automatically compile the LaTeX document and generate the corresponding PDF file.

6. Once the compilation is complete, you can download the resulting PDF file from the Overleaf interface.
